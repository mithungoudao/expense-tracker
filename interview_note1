ðŸ”¹ Step-by-Step Project Explanation
1. Structure
expense-tracker/
â”‚â”€â”€ app/
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ expense.py       # Expense & ExpenseTracker classes (OOP logic)
â”‚   â”‚â”€â”€ db_handler.py    # Handles SQLite queries
â”‚â”€â”€ streamlit_app.py     # Streamlit UI (CRUD in single page)
â”‚â”€â”€ expenses.db          # Database file (auto-created)

2. Code Files and Their Role
a) Expense class (Encapsulation)
class Expense:
    def __init__(self, id, date, category, amount, description=""):
        self.id = id
        self.date = date
        self.category = category
        self.amount = amount
        self.description = description


Each expense is stored as an object with its own data.

This is Encapsulation: data + behavior inside one unit.

b) ExpenseTracker class
class ExpenseTracker:
    def __init__(self, db_path="expenses.db"):
        self.db = DBHandler(db_path)   # Abstraction
        self.db.create_table()

    def add_expense(self, expense):   # Create
        return self.db.insert_expense(expense)

    def list_expenses(self):          # Read
        return self.db.fetch_all()

    def update_expense(self, id, expense):  # Update
        return self.db.update_expense(id, expense)

    def delete_expense(self, id):     # Delete
        return self.db.delete_expense(id)

    def totals_by_category(self):     # Aggregation
        return self.db.totals_by_category()


It calls DBHandler to run SQL â†’ this is Abstraction (user doesnâ€™t see SQL).

Provides CRUD methods.

c) DBHandler (SQL queries)
def insert_expense(self, expense):
    query = "INSERT INTO expenses (date, category, amount, description) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)"


Create â†’ INSERT

Read â†’ SELECT

Update â†’ UPDATE

Delete â†’ DELETE

ðŸ‘‰ This layer hides raw SQL from the rest of the program.
Later, you can inherit it to swap SQLite â†’ PostgreSQL/MySQL (shows Inheritance).

d) streamlit_app.py (UI)

Sidebar form â†’ Add new expense (Create).

Main page table â†’ Show all expenses (Read).

Update section â†’ Pick an ID and edit values (Update).

Delete section â†’ Pick an ID and remove (Delete).

Example:

# CREATE
with st.sidebar.form("add_form"):
    date = st.date_input("Date")
    category = st.selectbox("Category", ["Food", "Travel", "Bills"])
    amount = st.number_input("Amount")
    if st.form_submit_button("Add Expense"):
        tracker.add_expense(Expense(None, str(date), category, amount))


Here:

User enters input â†’ creates an Expense object â†’ calls tracker.add_expense() â†’ goes to DB.

3. Mapping to OOP Concepts

Encapsulation â†’ Expense keeps its data together.

Abstraction â†’ ExpenseTracker & DBHandler hide SQL details.

Polymorphism â†’ add_expense() or update_expense() work with any category or description.

Inheritance â†’ Later, you can subclass DBHandler for another database.

4. CRUD in Practice

Create â†’ Add new expense (INSERT into DB).

Read â†’ List all expenses in a table (SELECT from DB).

Update â†’ Select ID, modify values (UPDATE in DB).

Delete â†’ Select ID, remove (DELETE in DB).

ðŸ”¹ Now the Q&A (with code connections)
High-Level

Why Expense Tracker?
â†’ Easy, relatable, good for showing CRUD + OOP.

Problem solved?
â†’ Keeps track of personal spending with categories.

Why Streamlit?
â†’ Simple UI framework for forms/tables. No routes needed like Flask.

Why SQLite?
â†’ Built-in, supports CRUD, more efficient than CSV.

OOP

OOP concepts?
â†’ Encapsulation (Expense), Abstraction (DBHandler hides SQL), Polymorphism (CRUD works on any input), Inheritance (future DB support).

Encapsulation?
â†’ Expense data (id, date, amount) inside Expense.

Abstraction?
â†’ tracker.add_expense() calls DB, but user doesnâ€™t see INSERT SQL.

Inheritance?
â†’ Can extend DBHandler for PostgreSQL/MySQL.

Polymorphism?
â†’ Same method add_expense() works whether itâ€™s Food or Travel.

How OOP helps?
â†’ Keeps project modular, extendable, clean.

CRUD & DB

CRUD implemented?
â†’ Insert, Select, Update, Delete in DBHandler.

SQL queries?
â†’ INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE.

Persistence?
â†’ Stored in expenses.db file.

Why SQLite?
â†’ Easy for small apps; for scale, use PostgreSQL/MySQL.

Migrate DB?
â†’ Replace DBHandler queries.

Streamlit/UI

Streamlit reruns?
â†’ Script reruns each action, handled by forms/buttons.

Single page?
â†’ Simpler for demo; all CRUD visible together.

Streamlit vs Flask?
â†’ Streamlit auto-UI; Flask needs manual routes/templates.

Scalability

Limitations?
â†’ Single-user, no login, no advanced reports.

Future features?
â†’ Multi-user, charts, monthly reports.

Deploy?
â†’ Streamlit Cloud / Docker.

Multi-user?
â†’ Add user_id column in DB.

ðŸ”¹ Core Python OOP Questions & Straight Answers
-------------------------------------
What is a class and object in Python?
â€“ Class is a blueprint, object is an instance of it.

What is __init__?
â€“ A constructor method called automatically when an object is created.

What is self in Python?
â€“ Reference to the current object, used to access variables/methods of the class.

What are the types of methods in Python?
â€“ Instance method, Class method (@classmethod), Static method (@staticmethod).

What is Encapsulation?
â€“ Wrapping data & methods together in a class.

What is Abstraction?
â€“ Hiding internal details, showing only necessary functionality.

What is Inheritance?
â€“ A class acquiring properties & methods of another class.

What is Polymorphism?
â€“ Same method name works differently depending on context (e.g., + works for numbers and strings).

What is Method Overriding?
â€“ Redefining a parent class method in a child class.

What is Method Overloading?
â€“ Not directly supported in Python, but can use default args or *args to simulate.

What are Magic/Dunder methods?
â€“ Special methods like __str__, __len__, __add__.

Difference between __str__ and __repr__?
â€“ __str__ is for readable output, __repr__ is for unambiguous developer representation.

What is multiple inheritance in Python?
â€“ A class can inherit from multiple classes.

What is MRO (Method Resolution Order)?
â€“ The order in which Python looks for methods in case of multiple inheritance.

What is Composition?
â€“ Using objects of one class inside another (HAS-A relationship).
